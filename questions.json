A unidirectional link occurs when traffic is transmitted in one direction but not received back, which can lead to issues such as network loops or traffic blackholing.</p>\n\n<p>UDLD operates by exchanging protocol packets between neighboring devices. Each device sends UDLD packets containing its own device and port identifiers and expects to receive these packets back from its neighbor. If a device stops receiving these packets within a specified timeframe, it concludes that the link has become unidirectional and can take corrective action, such as disabling the affected port.</p>\n\n<p>This mechanism is particularly useful in scenarios where physical layer issues, such as miswiring or hardware failures, cause a link to become unidirectional. By detecting these issues at the data link layer, UDLD helps maintain network stability and prevent potential problems arising from unidirectional traffic flow.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, UDLD addresses the problem of <strong>a cable that sends traffic in only one direction</strong>.</p>",
